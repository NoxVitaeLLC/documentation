# 🧩 How to Use the Cross-Verification Bot
> The use of this bot is solely for users who have completed Age Verification successfully on VRChat and users who are linking 1 singular external-to-Discord account to Discord.


---


## ⚠️ Before You Begin
All messages from the bot are **ephemeral** — only you can see them.  
Please read each instruction carefully and follow the prompts in order.


---


## 🔗 Step 1 — Link Your Account


1. Click the **green “Link Account”** button in the Cross-Verification Panel.
2. Enter your **VRChat user ID** example: _*usr_XXXXXXX_XXXX_XXXX_XXXX_XXXXX*_
3. The field only accepts strings that begin with `usr_`.


❌ **Not accepted examples:**
- `cthulahoop` (username only)
- `https://vrchat.com/home`
- Any world URLs or incorrect formats


4. **Legacy users:**  
If your profile URL ends in a short string (e.g., **ABC123 or 123ABC and not _usr**) please contact support via email at **[Nox Vitae's Official Email](mailto:NoxVitaeOfficial@gmail.com)** or open a ticket in **[Nox Vitae's Discord](https://discord.gg/noxvitae)**.


5. If the ID is invalid, you’ll see this message:


> ⚠️ Invalid VRChat ID  
> The VRChat ID you provided is invalid. Please provide a valid VRChat ID.  
> Remember your ID is not your name: it’s the last part of your profile URL.


---


## 🪄 Step 2 — Verification Code


Once accepted, you’ll see:


> **Link your VRChat account**  
> You are about to link your Discord account with *YourName*.  
> Add the following code to your VRChat profile’s **Bio/Description** (not Status):  
> (Example:`NV-1234`)
> You have 5 minutes. After completing this, click the button below.


1. Go to **vrchat.com → Login → Profile**.
2. Paste the **NV-code** into your **Bio** (not your Status).  
You can remove it once verification is complete.
3. Return to Discord and click **Verify** *after* the code is visible on your profile.  
*(If you click too early, the attempt will time out.)*


---


## ✅ Step 3 — Update Verification (Blue Button)


This step confirms your **age verification** and badge visibility.


1. Click **Update Verification** after linking.
2. Make sure you’ve completed **VRChat’s age verification**.  
- VRChat+ subscribers can verify directly on the VRChat website.
- Show your desired badge (typically **+18 Verified**).
3. To update Nox Vitae’s database, click **Proceed with Update**.
- ⚠️ You may only update once per hour.
4. You’ll see one of these messages:
- **Verified Role** → You’re linked successfully.
- **+18 Verified** → You meet the server’s age badge requirement.


---


## 🔁 Step 4 — Sync (Grey Button)


If you join a **new server** using this bot:
- Click **Sync** to receive your roles automatically.  
- Required if the new server doesn’t have **Auto Verify** enabled.

### 💡 Notes
- The **Update Verification** feature is best used if:
    - You added your age badge after linking.
    - You’ve recently become **18+ verified** and need the bot to re-check your profile.
