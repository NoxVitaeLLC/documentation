# 🛠️ How to Use as a Server Owner


Follow these steps to integrate and configure the **Nox Vitae Cross-Verification Bot** for your Discord server.


---


## 🧩 Step 1 — Invite the Bot
Invite the official Cross-Verification Bot to your Discord server.


> 💡 **Tip:** You’ll need *Administrator* permissions to complete this process.


---


## 💳 Step 2 — Activate Your License
1. Purchase a subscription via **[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/)**.  
2. Once you have your license key, type the command: _*/activate*_
3. Enter your Gumroad license key when prompted.  
This connects your Discord server to your Nox Vitae subscription.


---


## ⚙️ Step 3 — Run the Setup Command
Run:_*/setup*_


During setup, you can:
- Select which roles the bot will manage or assign.  
- Pair one of your existing roles with the bot’s **18+ role**.  
  > ⚠️ Only one role can be paired with the bot’s 18+ role.


> 🪶 **Recommendation:** Keep all default Nox Vitae roles for best analytics and compatibility.


---


## 🧱 Step 4 — Adjust Role Hierarchy
After setup:
- Move the bot’s role **as high as possible** in your server’s role list.


> ⚠️ **Why?** Discord prevents lower roles from assigning higher ones.  
> Raising the bot’s role ensures proper permission control.


---


## 🧭 Step 5 — Create the Verification Panel
Run: _*/create_verification_panel*_


This creates the interactive verification panel for your users.  
For best results:
- Place it in a dedicated channel (e.g., `#verify-here`).  
- Restrict the channel so **@everyone** *cannot send messages or react*.  
  The bot manages all interactions automatically.


---


## 🎉 Step 6 — All Done!
Your verification panel is now live!  
Users can link their VRChat and Discord accounts seamlessly.


> 💫 You’re done — your community verification is automated, safe, and running smoothly!
