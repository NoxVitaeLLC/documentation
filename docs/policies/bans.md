# Ban Appeal Portal

We take all bans, timeouts, and appeals seriously at Nox Vitae.  
Our priority is creating a safe, mature, and well-moderated space for everyone who participates in our events and community.

## How to Appeal a Ban

### ✔ For Discord bans  
If you are still able to view [Nox Vitae's Discord](https://discord.gg/NoxVitae) use the appropriate appeal in our tickets section.



### ✉️ For full bans or if you're unable to access Discord  
You may contact Nox Vitae ownership directly via email to initiate a private appeal process.  
Email us at **[Nox Vitae's Official Email](mailto:NoxVitaeOfficial@gmail.com)**

## What to Include in Your Appeal

When submitting an appeal, please provide:

- The **username** of the platform you were banned on  
  *(Note: This applies only to Nox Vitae spaces — we do not control external services.)*
- A **brief explanation** of the situation or action you're appealing  
- The **outcome** you're hoping for  

We guarantee confidentiality.  
Unless we explicitly discuss involving another party, your appeal will remain private between you and ownership.
