As of 9/8/2025, the core functionality of the Nox Vitae verification bot — **specifically the ability to perform cross-verification between Discord and VRChat** — is provided free in perpetuity. This core verification functionality is not monetized and does not require payment for use.

Nox Vitae may offer optional, paid add-on features that are separate from and not derivative of the Discord–VRChat cross-verification process. These add-on features may enhance server management, automation, analytics, moderation workflows, or other non-verification-related capabilities.

Use of the Nox Vitae services requires a Nox Vitae account. A paid subscription is not required to access the core Discord–VRChat cross-verification functionality. Optional paid add-on features may be made available through subscription-based plans.

When a Subscription Account is used for optional paid features, Nox Vitae may send required service-related communications, such as billing notices, account updates, or changes to subscription status. These communications are necessary to provide the subscribed services and may not be opted out of while a subscription remains active.

You may also choose interactions and engagements to enable the experience and functionality you request. We may access, transfer, disclose, and/or retain Personal Data with consent, at your request, or in the circumstances described below.

This badge is not provided by us and does not contain any private information such as the individual’s exact birthday or other personal data.

### 8.3 Private Data - Birth Records
We do not handle or have access to any private information related to an individual's birthday. We only respect and rely on the badge to confirm that the individual has passed the necessary age verification step.

## 10. Information Protection and Retention

### 10.1 Information Protection
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for Personal Data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, loss, and misuse. These security measures include access controls, encryption, and firewalls. Unfortunately, no method of Internet use, data transmission, or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of Personal Data.

### 10.2 Your Responsibilities
While we are dedicated to securing our Website and services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your passwords and account information. We are not responsible for protecting Personal Data shared with a third-party based on an account connection that you have authorized.

### 10.3 Retention
We use and retain your Personal Data for, and as long as, necessary for the purpose for which it was provided, including any purposes set for in this Privacy Policy (e.g., for services, products, or interactions that you have requested or initiated; for communications with you; for invoicing, advertising, and marketing; for improving user experience, such as troubleshooting, optimization, and personalization; and to comply with legal, contractual, and regulatory obligations). We may also use and retain information for other purposes where you have given consent, such as in response to a pricing or hiring inquiry, or where a legitimate commercial interest exists.

Temporary verification state data, including pending verification records, is retained only for the duration necessary to complete or expire the verification process and is automatically cleared or rendered inactive once the verification window closes.

## 11. Accountability and Safeguards for Onward Transfer

### 11.1 Data Transfer
We provide services around the world. To provide our services, it may be necessary to transmit Personal Data outside of the country, state, or province where the data was received, including to the United States in circumstances where Nox Vitae acts as Controller. Such international data transfers may involve the flow of data from certain countries or regions to others that have different, and potentially less protective, privacy laws. To account for this, Nox Vitae strives to maintain appropriate internal and external data protections, including:
- (i) relying on legally or contractually adequate mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders in accordance with applicable laws; and
- (ii) obligating third parties, including applicable Processors and vendors, to provide at least the same level of data protection and use restriction as maintained by Nox Vitae and required by applicable laws.

### 11.2 Remedial Measures
If we learn Personal Data is not protected to our standard, or is being processed beyond your consent, we will take reasonable steps to protect your information and/or cease its illegitimate processing.

## 12. Data Subject Rights

### 12.1 Generally
Under applicable law, you may have the ability to exercise certain rights over your Personal Data. Because Nox Vitae values your Privacy, we strive to provide reasonable steps to allow you to access, rectify, erase, port, and restrict or object to the use of your Personal Data regardless of whether a specific statutory right to do so exists. When collection is based on your consent, we attempt to provide you with notice at collection and the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal by applicable law. If permitted by applicable law, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory or regulatory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data infringes your rights. Exercise of certain rights, including requests for deletion of Personal Data, may be limited in certain circumstances and may adversely affect our ability to serve you.

- All payments for previous subscriptions have been completed.* As of 9/17/2025, no user owes fees or payments to Nox Vitae, LLC., for services rendered by the bot or services.

We reserve any and all rights to decline requests to the extent permitted by applicable law.
