# Data Collection TL;DR

*Easier on the eyes, easier to read through what we do and do not collect—without the legal jargon in the way.*

**Please note:** by using our Discord servers and bots, you are agreeing to everything below and the hyperlinked resources. You can contact **[Nox Vitae's Official Email](mailto:NoxVitaeOfficial@gmail.com)** for any questions on our TOS.

The terms below are incorporated into, and form an integral part of, the Nox Vitae Terms of Service. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meaning ascribed them in the Terms of Service. Any breach of the terms below will be deemed a material breach of the Terms of Service.

## What data do we collect and store when you use our bot services?

**From “Users”**

- Discord User ID: This unique **and public** identifier links your Discord account to our services.
- VRChat User ID: This unique **and public** identifier helps link your VRChat account. *(You provide this manually.)*
- VRChat Age Verified Badge Status: A public identifier used to assign roles accordingly.
- Temporary Verification Data: When you initiate verification, we temporarily store a pending verification record (Discord User ID, Discord Guild ID, and verification expiration status) solely to manage verification timeouts and completion (including expiration timestamp and processed flag)

**From “Servers”**

- Discord Guild ID (aka Server ID): Used to identify your server.
- Role IDs: Verified and +18 role IDs so the bot can assign them.

---

## Why do we collect that data?

We use this information strictly to link your Discord and VRChat accounts, enabling the bot to assign roles based on your age verification badge. This is the minimum necessary for the bot to work. See our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) and [Terms of Service](./terms-of-service.md) for full definitions.

---

## What don’t we collect when you use the bot?

- No email addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, usernames, passwords, or real names.
- No data from your VRChat account beyond what you explicitly provide (e.g., no friends list, world data, etc.).

---

## Data Access

Your data is only accessed by priveleged users (those who Nox Vitae have employed to build/maintain the cross-verification bot) for maintenance purposes. This access is limited and monitored to protect your privacy.

---

## Data Sharing / Selling

**We do not share, sell, or distribute your data to anyone.** Your data stays within Nox Vitae and is only used for providing the bot’s functionality.

---

## Data Storage

All data is securely stored by our hosting provider. We use industry-standard protections against unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure.

---

## User Rights

You may request to remove your data at any time. See the [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) for instructions on how to initiate this.

---

## Data Retention

We retain only the data necessary for the bot to function.

- Temporary verification data (such as pending verification records) is stored only during the verification window and is automatically cleared or marked inactive once verification is completed or expires.
- Account linking data (such as Discord and VRChat IDs) is retained only while the bot is active in a server or until a deletion request is made.
- When the bot is removed from a server or when a valid data deletion request is submitted, associated data is securely deleted in accordance with applicable laws.

---

## Data Compliance Standards

We comply with standard data privacy frameworks. See our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) for more details.

---

## COPPA Compliance

**Our services are for users 18+ only.** We do not knowingly store data for minors. If you believe this has occurred, please contact **[Nox Vitae's Official Email](mailto:NoxVitaeOfficial@gmail.com)**.
