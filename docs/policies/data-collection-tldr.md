# Data Collection TL;DR

*An easy-to-read overview of what data we collect and why—without legal jargon.*

**Please note:** By using our Discord servers and bots, you agree to the terms below and the hyperlinked resources.  
For questions, contact **[Nox Vitae Official Email](mailto:NoxVitaeOfficial@gmail.com)**.

The terms below are incorporated into, and form an integral part of, the Nox Vitae Terms of Service. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning assigned in the Terms of Service.

## What data do we collect and store when you use our bot services?

### From Users

- **Discord User ID**  
  A unique and public identifier used to associate you with verification and role assignment.

- **VRChat User ID**  
  A unique and public identifier used to link your VRChat account. *(Provided manually by you.)*

- **VRChat Age-Verified Badge Status**  
  A public badge state used to determine eligibility for age-restricted roles.

- **Temporary Verification Data**  
  When you initiate verification, we temporarily store a pending verification record to manage timeouts and completion. This may include:
  - Discord User ID  
  - Discord Guild ID  
  - Verification expiration timestamp  
  - Processed status (completed or expired)  
  - *(Optional)* server join timestamp, used only for verification timing logic

---

### From Servers

- **Discord Guild ID (Server ID)**  
  Used to identify the server where the bot is installed.

- **Server Name**  
  Stored for internal reference and system clarity.

- **Role IDs**  
  Stored so the bot can function correctly. These may include:
  - Verification role ID  
  - Age-restricted (18+) role ID  
  - Linked role ID  
  - Unverified role ID  
  - Swap role IDs (used for automated role changes)  
  - Timeout role ID (used by the verification timeout system)

These values are configuration data, not personal user information.

---

## Why do we collect this data?

We collect only the minimum data required to:

- Link Discord and VRChat accounts
- Verify age status
- Assign, remove, or swap roles automatically
- Enforce verification time limits
- Operate server-specific configuration safely and consistently

For full legal definitions, see our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) and [Terms of Service](./terms-of-service.md).

## Data Access

Data is accessible only to authorized Nox Vitae personnel involved in development and maintenance of the bot.  
Access is limited, logged where applicable, and used solely for operational purposes.

---

## Data Sharing / Selling

**We do not sell, share, or distribute user or server data.**  
All collected data is used exclusively to provide bot functionality.

---

## User Rights

You may request deletion of your data at any time.  
Instructions are available in our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md).

---

## Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary for the bot to function:

- **Temporary verification data** is retained only during the active verification window and is cleared or marked inactive once completed or expired.
- **Account linking data** (Discord and VRChat IDs) is retained only while the bot is active in a server or until a valid deletion request is received.
- **Server configuration data** is retained only while the bot remains installed.
- When the bot is removed from a server, associated data is deleted in accordance with applicable laws.
