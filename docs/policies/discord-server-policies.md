## Moderation & Enforcement

- **⚠️ Timeout – First Offense:**  
  For general rule violations not subject to instant ban. Serves as a formal warning and cool-down period.

- **⚠️ Ban – Second Offense:**  
  Repeating violations after a timeout may result in a ban. Bans are at Nox Vitae leadership’s discretion.

- **⛔ Instant Ban Includes:**  
  - Minors (under 18) attempting to access the community, services, or website(s)  
  - Posting NSFW imagery or links  
  - Malicious hate speech or targeted harassment  
  - Major Discord TOS violations (e.g., spam, raids, scams)

## Reporting Safety Concerns

If you believe someone is at risk or a serious violation has occurred in VRChat, Discord, or real life, please report it to the relevant platform and, where appropriate, local law enforcement, *before* contacting us.  

__**This is especially critical if you believe a minor is involved.**__

- **Discord Trust & Safety:**  
  [Discord's Ticket Portal](https://dis.gd/report)

- **VRChat Support (Moderation/Safety):**  
  [VRChat Help Portal → Submit a request](https://help.vrchat.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)

- **Emergency / Imminent Harm:**  
  Contact your local authorities first.

After you’ve submitted reports to the appropriate parties, you may notify Nox Vitae so we can take independent action within our community.  
We may remove access for users we reasonably believe pose a safety risk, and we may share relevant evidence (including reporter details) with the appropriate authorities or platforms if necessary.

## Ban Appeals

- ✔ You may appeal by opening a ticket in  [our Discord](https://discord.gg/NoxVitae) *or* [Email us](mailto:noxvitaeofficial@gmail.com)

- ✔ Include the banned account name and the platform/service (Discord, VRChat, or Nox Vitae services).

- ✖ Appeals on behalf of someone else are not accepted.

- ✔ Appeals are reviewed by leadership only. Decisions are final unless re-opened by internal admin consensus.

- ✔ If a member violates a collaborator’s rules, we will review the concern seriously, but final enforcement remains with Nox Vitae leadership.

- ✔ Nox Vitae may decline any partnership, collaboration, or participation for violations of our values or Terms of Service.
