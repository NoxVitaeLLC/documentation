# Nox Vitae VR Event Rules

These rules apply to all Nox Vitae events inside VRChat. They ensure a safe, immersive, and respectful space for all guests, staff, and collaborators.

---

## ✔ First Offense – Warning or Kick

**Talking about drama:** Including club gossip or inter-community disputes. First time: pulled aside and warned.

**NSFW avatars or ERP:** All avatars must be fully clothed.  
- Male avatars: must wear pants  
- Female avatars: must wear top and bottom

**Disrespecting staff instructions:** Ignoring warnings to change avatars, reduce mic spam, or follow spatial guidance. 

**Mic spamming:** Talking over DJs, blasting audio, or disrupting live sets during featured hours.

**Entering staff-only areas:** Access is limited to official event staff. Guests entering without permission will be removed.

## ✖ Second Offense – Ban

- Any repeated behavior listed above  
- Continued refusal to cooperate with staff moderation  
- Second NSFW or ERP violation in avatar or behavior  

---

## ✖ Instant Ban Offenses

- Minor detected (under 18): Permanently banned across all instances  
- NSFW imagery posted in chat  
- Malicious hate speech or harassment: Racist, sexist, homophobic, or ableist language or behavior  
- Major Discord TOS violations: Includes spam, raids, doxing, or threats of DDoS or harm  

---

## ✔ In-World Moderation

- All moderation is handled by trained Nox Vitae event staff  
- Warnings may be verbal, via private message, or through pull-aside teleportation  
- Major offenses will be reported to community leadership for further action  
- Bans may extend beyond a single event or instance depending on severity  

---

## Appeals, Collaboration, and Autonomy

- ✔ Our ban/unban process and appeal policy is publicly available and takes place in two places, as needed: within our Discord server, or through an alternate contact if the applicant is banned.  
- ✔ Appeals are reviewed by leadership only. All decisions are final unless re-opened through internal admin consensus.  
- ✔ If a member breaks a collaborator’s rules and it’s brought to us, we take the concern seriously — but all final enforcement decisions are handled internally by Nox Vitae leadership.  
- ✔ Nox Vitae reserves the right to decline any partnership, collaboration, or participation with any individual or entity for violations of our [Core Values](../about-credits/index.md) or Terms of Service.  

Entering a Nox Vitae event means agreeing to these rules. Thank you for helping us maintain a fun, immersive space for all.
