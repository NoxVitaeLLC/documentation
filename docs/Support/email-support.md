## 🔍 If Your Issue Occurs on Another Platform

If your concern involves an incident that took place outside of Nox Vitae-managed environments (e.g. within VRChat public instances, third-party Discord servers, or social platforms):

- ➡️ We will provide **guidance and links** to the appropriate reporting channels  
- ➡️ **We cannot/do not collect evidence** against individuals or organizations for public use.  
- ➡️ **We cannot escalate or enforce anything outside our administration scope**

## 📎 Example Resolution Flow

| Scenario | Our Role |
|----------|----------|
| Violation *within* Nox Vitae’s public Discord (e.g. `https://discord.gg/noxvitae`) | Investigate internally and take appropriate action. We may escalate to Discord Trust & Safety depending on severity. |
| Behavior occurring in another Discord server | Recommend contacting that server’s leadership and submitting a report to Discord Trust & Safety if appropriate. |
| Incident occurring in VRChat (outside of a Nox Vitae-managed event) | Provide guidance on how to submit a VRChat Trust & Safety report. For safety concerns, we strongly encourage contacting local authorities. |
| Illegal or high-risk behavior reported via third-party sources | We will advise submitting reports directly to appropriate platform safety teams and, if necessary, encourage contacting local law enforcement. We cannot act without first-party evidence. |

## 🚨 When to Contact Authorities or Platform Safety Teams

If your report may involve:
- Interaction with or targeting of a **minor**
- **Harassment**, stalking, or threats
- **Sexual misconduct**
- **Illegal activity** or coercion

➡️ You should file reports directly to the platform where the safety concern happens. Please do not forget to report the issues directly to your local law enforcement. 

Our team can **help recommend the best authrity to contact** but **we cannot file on your/another's behalf**.
